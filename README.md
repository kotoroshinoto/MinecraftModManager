# MinecraftModManager
Similar in concept to multimc

Will need some redevelopment to work for newer versions of minecraft.
I may end up making a server-focused tool and leave multimc to be the client oriented one.

When completed it should allow simultaneous launch of one instance of client & one instance of server with selected mods installed & runtime configurations.

It should be able to capture output streams so that informative text regarding java exceptions can be forwarded to the appropriate modders.
---Have not yet decided whether to perform the above via text-file capture or console buffer.

UI will be implemented with wxwidgets, to enable full functionality on all supported platforms
